## Description:

This app began with the starter code ready to go, but was missing aspects that would make it a Progressive Web Application(PWA).
It is a text editor that is now able to be installed as an app to allow it to be used offline. I had to fill out the javascript files as well as the src.sw.js. The goal was to outline the webpack plugins, and use the IndexedDB in the browser.

## Installation:

This app used 'idb' package, 'express' and 'if-env'. For dev-dependencies, I used 'concurrently' and 'nodemon'.

## Learned:

It was a great lesson on webpack and babel, so that now using React, I can understand what's happening 'under the hood'.
